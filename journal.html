      Well Imade it 1200 miles already, and I passe through some interesting places on the way: Walla walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences,NM.

      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: "Passing cars, when you can't ssee, May get you, A glimpse, of eternity." I definitely won't be passing any cars.

    <blockquote>Passing cars,
      when you can't see,
      May  get you,
      A glimpse,
      Of eternity.

      My first day of the trip! I cann't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
